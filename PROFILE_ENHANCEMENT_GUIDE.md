## üìù Update Workflow

### Step 1: Review Interview Feedback

After each interview simulation, create a feedback summary:

```
Interview Type: Comprehensive
Date: 2025-10-21
Overall Score: 7/10

Gaps Identified:
- Missing salary/location information (CRITICAL)
- Weak leadership examples
- No mention of testing experience
- Vague project descriptions without metrics
- Missing remote work experience details

Strengths:
- Strong technical knowledge
- Good communication
- Relevant project experience
```

### Step 2: Update digitaltwin.json

Open your `digitaltwin.json` file and add missing information:

1. **Add salary/location** (if missing)
2. **Convert 2-3 major projects to STAR format**
3. **Add leadership examples**
4. **Quantify all achievements**
5. **Add technical skills with years**

### Step 3: Re-embed

After updating your JSON:

```powershell
cd c:\DigitalTwin\digital-twin-workshop
python embed_digitaltwin.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Updates

Test that your updates work:

```
@workspace Query my digital twin for my salary expectations and location preferences.
```

```
@workspace What leadership examples can you find in my digital twin profile?
```

### Step 5: Re-test Interview

Run the same interview simulation again:

```
@workspace Using my UPDATED digital twin MCP server data, conduct another interview simulation for the job in job-postings/job1.md. Compare with previous feedback.
```
