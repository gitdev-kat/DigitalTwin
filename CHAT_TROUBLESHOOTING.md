# CatheTwin Chat Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed: Chat Not Sending Messages

### What Was Wrong?
The chat interface was using the deprecated `onKeyPress` event handler, which may not work properly in newer browsers.

### What I Fixed:
Changed `onKeyPress` to `onKeyDown` in the textarea element.

## üîß How to Fix on Your End

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser
The code has been updated, but your browser might be using the old cached version.

**Try these methods (in order):**

1. **Hard Refresh** (Recommended):
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Clear Cache & Reload**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Reload the page

3. **Close & Reopen**:
   - Close the browser tab completely
   - Open a new tab
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/chat

---

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Open the chat**: http://localhost:3000/chat

2. **Type a question** in the text box, for example:
   - "What is your role at JPCS?"
   - "Tell me about your work experience"
   - "What are your technical skills?"

3. **Send the message** using either:
   - Press `Enter` key
   - Click the `Send` button

4. **You should see**:
   - Your message appear in a purple bubble
   - CatheTwin's response in a gray bubble
   - Three bouncing dots while waiting for response

## ‚ùå If Still Not Working

### Check Browser Console

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Common issues:
   - Network errors (API not reachable)
   - JavaScript errors (code issues)
   - CORS errors (security restrictions)

### Verify Server is Running

```powershell
# Check if server is running
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/health"

# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

### Test API Directly

```powershell
# Test the chat API
$body = @{message="Hello"; history=@()} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/chat" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

# Should return a response from CatheTwin
```

---

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Working

I've tested the API and it's working correctly:

**Test Query**: "What is your role at JPCS?"

**Response**: "I'm currently serving as the Secretary of the Junior Philippine Computer Society (JPCS) - SPUP Chapter. As Secretary, my responsibilities include recording and distributing meeting proceedings, ensuring accurate documentation of club activities, facilitating communication between the President and members, and checking attendance during meetings."

## üîÑ What Was Updated

### Role Change:
- **Before**: JPCS Vice President
- **After**: JPCS Secretary ‚úÖ

### Files Updated:
1. ‚úÖ `src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Fixed input handler
2. ‚úÖ `cathetwin.py` - Updated role
3. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Updated role
4. ‚úÖ `digitaltwin.json` - Updated role throughout
5. ‚úÖ `CATHETWIN_README.md` - Updated role
6. ‚úÖ `CATHETWIN_QUICKREF.txt` - Updated role

---

## üí° Alternative: Use CLI Chat

If the web chat still doesn't work, you can use the command-line version:

```powershell
cd c:\DigitalTwin\digital-twin-workshop\digital-twin-new
python cathetwin.py
```

This works independently of the web interface and has the same AI capabilities.
